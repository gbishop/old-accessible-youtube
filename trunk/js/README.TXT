To future Accessible YouTube developers: before jumping into the code itself, I recommend reading the following summary. Hopefully it will make the code easier to understand.

The Accessible YouTube page consists of 5 parts. At the top is the banner with a link back to the Welcome Page. Below that is the movie list. It consists of thumbnails for a few YouTube videos, among which the user can choose. Below that are the player and the player controls. At the bottom is an area for information about the current movie (the title and the description).

Accessible YouTube uses a basic embedded YouTube player controlled by JavaScript. All of the controls on the page are activated by JavaScript. Some parts of the page (such as the player and the pause button in the player controls or the next/previous/back buttons in the movie list) are even generated by JavaScript. As a result, there is a significant amount of time taken when the player page is first loaded in setting everything up.

Switch accessibility is accomplished by always keeping track of a "selected" node (highlighted with a 5 pixel red border, as specified in the CSS). When choosing a movie, one of the movies is selected; when playing a movie, one of the player controls is selected. The keyboard controls consist of a "mover" and a "chooser." The mover changes the selected node to the next one in its menu. The chooser chooses the currently selected node. For changing the selected node from within code, the selectNode function is used. If the selected node is changed from a node in one menu to a node in another, there is code to be executed to indicate this (greying out the old menu, for example). The selectNode function automatically deals with this, so generally that code should not be called by hand.

Mouse support is also implemented. When it would not mess up the program, hovering over a node is usually equivalent to selecting (highlighting) it and clicking is usually equivalent to choosing it.

Personal settings are stored in cookies. Information about the movies to be retrieved from YouTube is encoded into the URL on the player page (after the "?").

The movie list actually consists of more movies than fit on the screen (usually). Most of them, however, are hidden, and thus there are arrows on the sides that can be used to scroll through them. When scrolled all the way to the left, if browsing is not disabled, the left arrow serves instead as a back button.
